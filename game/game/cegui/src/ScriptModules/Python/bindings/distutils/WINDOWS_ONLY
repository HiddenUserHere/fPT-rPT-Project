Since Linux has standards and autotools install PyCEGUI nicely there, there
is no need to support distutils there. Windows however has no standards what
so ever plus it has up to 93% more noobs than Linux. Therefore Windows MSI
installers can be created with distutils and setup.py here.

Thanks for understanding
