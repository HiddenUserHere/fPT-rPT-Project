How to generate distutils package:

1) generate the bindings sources
2) cd into this folder
3) call python setup.py bdist_msi ("python" has to be the python you want this package for!)

bdist_msi could be bdist_wininst but wininst has problems with UAC elevation and
other things so MSI is probably the way to go
